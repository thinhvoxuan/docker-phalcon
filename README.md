# Phalcon Dockerfiles

Dockerfiles located in this repository entirely used for internal purposes.
We would like to leave in this repository only those Dockerfiles that we need to build `deb` and `rmp` packages.

During some time no longer supported Docker images will be available at the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/phalconphp/).
The source code of old Docker images is located at [`legacy`](https://github.com/phalcon/dockerfiles/tree/legacy) branch.
